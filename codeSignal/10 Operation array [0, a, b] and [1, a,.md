given an array of operations:
every operation is like [0, a, b] or [1, a, b]
[0, a, b] means create a rectangle ab
[1, a, b] is query, that asks us: could every rectangle we save is smaller than(or in other words, fit in) the dimension given here(ab)?
we return an array that contains all the query results with boolean values
