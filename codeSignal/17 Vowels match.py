# 017 Vowels match



# given an string s. and another string called pattern,
# for example, s = amazing pattern=“010”
# 0 means there should be vowel and 1 means there is not
# calculate the number of substring of s that meets the given pattern.
# return the number.

# note: a e i o u y count as vowels.

# like one of those string matching algorithm, the time complexity for this will be O(n-m) where n is the length of s and m is the length of pattern
