# 008 Prefix Palindrome
# implement the following algorithm:

# get the longest prefix of given string s, who is also a palindrome.
# if the prefix we choose has at least two characters, we cut this prefix from s, and update s. repeat step one

# so in all, this means, keep doing this algorithm until there is non prefix palindrome left(only contains one letter)
