// 028 Max Revenue From Stock

// we are given an array of integers, stock. represents the prices.
// and we are given another array called algo, represents for the actions we need to take everyday. and in this array, we have 0 and 1 in this array originally, 0 means buy and 1 means sell.
// now we are also given a number, k, means we need to set a consecutive k elements to 1 that maximize the profit for the new actions. we can imagine the action of algo as robot, and itâ€™s our job it modify them based on the k we are given to get as much profit as possible.

// return the maximum profit we can get.
